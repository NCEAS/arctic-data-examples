# **Paleontology/Paleoecology** {-#paleo}

The following dataset(s) are "paleo-" focused. "Paleo-" is a latin prefix meaning “old” or “ancient,” especially in reference to former geologic time periods. This section will feature datasets from the paleontology and paleoecology branches of science.

Paleontology is the study of the history of life on Earth as based on fossils. Fossils are the remains of plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and single-celled living things that have been replaced by rock material or impressions of organisms preserved in rock.

Paleoecology is the study of interactions between once-living organisms and their environmental surroundings. Interactions between organisms can take a variety of forms, including competition between similar organisms for resources, predation of one organism by another, and symbiosis between different organisms to enable each organism to survive and reproduce.

**The Data**

[Sediment core data related to the extinction of Mammuthus primigenius, St. Paul Island, Alaska, 2014.](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA24746R6K)

This dataset is brought to you by [Matthew Wooller](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/matthew-wooller.php) (he/him), an interdisciplinary scientist who works on applying stable isotope techniques to understand the influence of changing environmental conditions on past and present ecosystems. Isotopes (of C,N,O,H and Sr) feature as the primary analytical tools that Dr. Wooller uses to study a wide range of environmental and ecological questions. 

The full paper associated with this dataset is available [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/33/9310).

**What We Know**

Even though most mainland woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) populations went extinct on mainland North America around 14,000 years ago, some populations survived on several small [Beringian](https://www.nps.gov/articles/aps-v12-i2-c8.htm) islands for thousands of years later. Specifically, woolly mammoth populations on St. Paul Island were likely alive until about 6,000 years ago. Normally, extinction happens because of environmental change, human impacts, or a combination of both. But, St. Paul Island wasn't populated by humans until the 1700s, so these researchers were able to study when and why these mammals went extinct specifically from environmental change. The prevailing hypotheses as to why these animals died out were that there was a change in vegetation or an increase in snowpack; these authors used sediment core proxy methods and radio carbon dating of 14 newly discovered mammoth remains to better understand what happened.

**What we found out**

Instead, the extinction coincided with declining freshwater resources and drier climates between 7,850 and 5,600 years ago, as inferred from sedimentary magnetic susceptibility, oxygen isotopes, and diatom and cladoceran assemblages in a sediment core from a freshwater lake on the island, and stable nitrogen isotopes from mammoth remains. 

Contrary to other extinction models for the St. Paul mammoth population, this new evidence indicates that this mammoth population died out because of the synergistic effects of shrinking island area and freshwater scarcity caused by rising sea levels and regional climate change. Degradation of water quality by intensified mammoth activity around the lake likely exacerbated the situation. The St. Paul mammoth demise is now one of the best-dated prehistoric extinctions, highlighting freshwater limitation as an overlooked extinction driver and underscoring the vulnerability of small island populations to environmental change, even in the absence of human influence.

*Paleoenvironmental proxies at Lake Hill, plotted against time. Shown are relative abundances of planktonic (blue bars), tychoplanktonic (maroon bars), and high-conductivity–tolerant diatoms (orange bars); ratio of pelagic and littoral cladocerans (gray curve); relative abundance (%) of cladoceran Alona circumfibriata, which is tolerant of high lake water conductivity (purple bars); δ18O values from aquatic invertebrate chitin (blue curve); δ15N values from mammoth collagen (red curve); sediment magnetic susceptibility (in AU); and accumulation rates for herb and shrub pollen types (light green and tan curves, respectively). The estimated timing of extinction is indicated by the yellow vertical bar (Graham et al. 2016).*
