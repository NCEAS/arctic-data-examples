Overview The Arctic Data Center is a place for researchers from around the world working in the Arctic to efficiently share, discover, access, and interpret complex data about the Arctic with less effort. Part of our mission is to provide hands on training at Arctic research conferences and in dedicated training sessions targeting Arctic researchers, especially early-career and under-represented populations. In 2020, we were able to support the development of undergraduate-level educational materials through our fellowship program. These materials are open source and available for reuse and/or modification either at the associated GitHub repository, the Arctic Data Center Training page, or the DataOne Skillbuilding Hub. With over 5,700 datasets in the Arctic Data Center repository, these educational materials are intended to equip students with the necessary tools and resources to unearth the story behind the data, one about one of the planet’s fastest-changing ecosystems: the Arctic. Encompassing Earth’s northern most region, the Arctic is an icy sea surrounded by land characterized by a harsh climate with extreme variation in light and temperature. Diverse landscapes—from the sea ice to coastal wetlands, upland tundra, mountains, wide rivers, and the sea itself—support abundant wildlife and many cultures making the Arctic a region like no other in the world. However, what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average. The cause of such rapid warming is straightforward and well understood: It is human-caused climate change, and it is altering the relative amount of the Sun’s energy that is absorbed, reflected, or radiated in the Arctic. According to 15th annual NOAA Arctic Report Card, the sea-ice extent in October of 2020 dropped to the lowest levels on record. Dramatic drops in Arctic ice like this are the main driver for rapid Arctic changes. Effects of a warming atmosphere on physical, chemical, biological, and human components of Arctic ecosystems are myriad, far-reaching, and accelerating. There is no facet of Arctic life that will remain untouched by the immensity of these changes. Studying and understanding the Arctic is essential txo saving it, and ultimately ourselves. The Arctic Data Center repository is rich with real-world Arctic data just waiting to be explored. If you’re ready to learn how, let’s get started.

The Arctic Ocean is the shallowest ocean on Earth. It’s complex oceanographic configuration is tightly linked to the atmosphere, the land, and the cryosphere. The physical dynamics not only drive important climate and global circulation patterns, but also control biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem dynamics. Current changes in Arctic sea-ice thickness and distribution, air and water temperatures, and water column stability are resulting in measurable shifts in the properties and functioning of the ocean and its ecosystems. The Arctic Ocean is forecast to shift to a seasonally ice-free ocean resulting in changes to physical, chemical, and biological processes. These include the exchange of gases across the atmosphere-ocean interface, the wind-driven circulation and mixing regimes, light and nutrient availability for primary production, food web dynamics, and export of material to the deep ocean. In anticipation of these changes, extending our knowledge of the present Arctic oceanography and these complex changes has never been more urgent. Frost flowers on young Arctic sea ice The Data Frost flowers on young Arctic sea ice: The climatic, chemical and microbial significance of an emerging ice type This dataset is brought to you by Jody W. Deming (she/her), an American oceanographer. She is a professor of Oceanography and a marine microbiologist at the University of Washington. Her research interests include studies of cold adapted microbes in their relation to astrobiology, biotechnology, and bioremediation. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What we know Frost flowers are highly saline ice structures that grow on the surface of young sea ice, a spatially extensive environment of increasing importance in the Arctic Ocean. Although frost flower blooms are frequently observed in both polar oceans, little is understood about the physical, chemical and biological nature of these structures. To investigate their microbiology Bowman and Deming learned to grow frost flowers in a freezer lab at the University of Washington before moving their study into the field, collecting frost flowers during several challenging expeditions. With these first samples they have begun to develop the concept of frost flowers as a microbial habitat. Their goal is to probe the secrets of microbial life in very cold environments, a priority of the astrobiology community. Since many of the planets and moons in our solar system that might harbor life are very cold and covered in ice, determining the habitability of these planets and moons requires an understanding of the limits of life (as we know it) in the very coldest environments on Earth. What we found out Ice grown in a pond cut in young ice at the mouth of Young Sound, NE Greenland, in March 2012, showed that expanding frost flower clusters began forming as soon as the ice formed. The new ice and frost flowers dramatically changed the radiative and thermal environment. The frost flowers were about 5°C colder than the brine surface, with an approximately linear temperature gradient from their base to their upper tips. Bacteria concentrations generally increased with salinity in frost flowers and the surface slush layer. Bacterial densities and taxa indicated that a selective process occurred at the ice surface and confirmed the general pattern of primary oceanic origin versus negligible atmospheric deposition.

A significant expansion of larch forests to moss-lichen and heath tundra areas over the past 50-60 years has been documented in western Siberia, with horizontal displacement rates of 32-58 meters per decade and altitudinal rates of 3-4 meters per decade. These vegetation changes may have the potential to impact regional hydrology and climate. What we found out Growing season latent and sensible heat flux are nearly equal over the Arctic permafrost tundra regions. Persistent ground heat flux into the subsurface layer leads to seasonal thaw of the top permafrost layer. The Maximum Energy Production model accurately estimates the latent, sensible, and ground heat flux of the surface energy budget of the Arctic permafrost regions.

She also investigates the effects of global change on these processes, such as how land cover and land use change alter the fluxes of trace gases to the atmosphere. What we know There has been an unprecedented increase in Arctic wildfire occurrences in recent years. This Arctic Observing Network (AON) project focuses on the study of Arctic tundra wildfires through continuous observations of atmospheric fire tracers, including carbon monoxide, methane, and a series of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitored at the Greenland Environmental Observatory at Summit (GEOSummit), the only high altitude, high latitude, inland, year‐round observing station in the Arctic.

What we know Cold seasons in Arctic ecosystems are increasingly important to the annual carbon balance of these vulnerable ecosystems. Arctic winters are largely harsh and inaccessible leading historic data gaps during that time. Until recently, cold seasons have been assumed to have negligible impacts on the annual carbon balance but as data coverage increases and the Arctic warms, the cold season has been shown to account for over half of annual methane (CH4) emissions and can offset summer photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake. Freeze–thaw cycle dynamics play a critical role in controlling cold season CO2 and CH4 loss, but the relationship has not been extensively studied. What we found out The researchers analyzed freeze–thaw processes through in situ CO2 and CH4 fluxes in conjunction with soil cores for physical structure and porewater samples for redox biogeochemistry. They found a movement of water toward freezing fronts in soil cores, leaving air spaces in soils, which allows for rapid infiltration of oxygen‐rich snow melt in spring as shown by oxidized iron in porewater. The snow melt period coincides with rising ecosystem respiration and can offset up to 41% of the summer CO2 uptake.

Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with one another and with their physical environment.

Oberbauer, Jonathan Moser, Gregory Starr, and Behzad Mortazavi. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What We Know The cold season in the Arctic extends over 8 to 9 mo, yet little is known about vascular plant physiology during this period. Evergreen species photosynthesize under the snow, implying that they are exchanging water with the atmosphere. However, liquid water available for plant uptake may be limited at this time. What we found out Evergreen tundra plants take up water under snow cover, some via roots, but also likely by foliar uptake. The ability to take up water in the subnivean environment allows evergreen tundra plants to take advantage of mild spring conditions under the snow and replenish carbon lost by winter respiration.

Dr. Gooseff conducts on-going research in Arctic Alaska, mostly from the Toolik Field Station and continues research in Antarctica. The paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. Check out the research webpage here. What We Know Aufeis are massive accumulations of ice that are features of many arctic rivers. They form during freeze-up when thickening surface ice causes local overflows. Successive cycles of overflow result in accumulations of enormous volumes of ice, with aufeis on some Alaskan rivers attaining thicknesses of 3-5 meters, covering more than 20 square kilometers, and storing as much as 30% of the annual river discharge. Although aufeis have been studied by hydrologists and are known to be required for winter and spawning habitat for some fish, understanding of their ecology is poor. What we found out The Kuparuk aufeis field provides subsurface habitat for a rich assemblage of freshwater invertebrates distinct from those occurring in surface level habitats. This level of richness is presumably enabled by the relatively high porosity of the subsurface sediments combined with a high level of connectivity between pore spaces. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a groundwater (e.g., hyporheic/parafluvial/groundwater) invertebrate fauna in a region of continuous permafrost. Rarefaction curves for invertebrates sampled from wells (closed circles) and surface sediments (open circles). The mean cumulative number of taxa per number of samples is plotted as a function of accumulated number of individuals sampled. Note: In ecology, rarefaction is a technique to assess species richness from the results of sampling. Rarefaction allows the calculation of species richness for a given number of individual samples, based on the construction of so-called rarefaction curves. This curve is a plot of the number of species as a function of the number of samples. Rarefaction curves generally grow rapidly at first, as the most common species are found, but the curves plateau as only the rarest species remain to be sampled.

S Soil respiration, water chemistry, and soil gas data for thermokarst features and undisturbed tundra on the North Slope of Alaska Photo credit: Yuri Kozyrev/NOOR/eyevine The Data Labeling study of water use by tundra evergreens in the winter spring transition This dataset is brought to you by Ben Abbott (he/him), an Assistant Professor of Ecosystem Ecology at Brigham Young Universityy. Ben works primarily on the permafrost climate feedback and water quality in river networks. Drawing on biogeochemistry, evolutionary biology, and social science, his research investigates how the co-evolution of landscapes and ecosystems results in broad-scale patterns of biological, hydrological, and socioeconomic behavior. Specifically, he studies how permafrost collapse, agriculture, fire, and flooding affect carbon and nutrient cycles in soil, groundwater, rivers, and lakes. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What We Know Release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost is potentially the largest terrestrial feedback to climate change and one of the most likely to occur; however, estimates of its strength vary by a factor of thirty. Some of this uncertainty stems from abrupt thaw processes known as thermokarst (permafrost collapse due to ground ice melt), which alter controls on carbon and nitrogen cycling and expose organic matter from meters below the surface. Thermokarst may affect 20–50% of tundra uplands by the end of the century; however, little is known about the effect of different thermokarst morphologies on carbon and nitrogen release. What we found out After measuring soil organic matter displacement, ecosystem respiration, and soil gas concentrations at 26 upland thermokarst features on the North Slope of Alaska, the researchers found that thermokarst morphology interacted with landscape parameters to determine both the initial displacement of organic matter and subsequent carbon and nitrogen cycling. The large proportion of ecosystem carbon exported off‐site by slumps and slides resulted in decreased ecosystem respiration postfailure, while gullies removed a smaller portion of ecosystem carbon but strongly increased respiration and N2O concentration. Elevated N2O in gully soils persisted through most of the growing season, indicating sustained nitrification and denitrification in disturbed soils, representing a potential noncarbon permafrost climate feedback. While upland thermokarst formation did not substantially alter redox conditions within features, it redistributed organic matter into both oxic and anoxic environments. Across morphologies, residual organic matter cover, and predisturbance respiration explained 83% of the variation in respiration response. Consistent differences between upland thermokarst types may contribute to the incorporation of this nonlinear process into projections of carbon and nitrogen release from degrading permafrost.

Paleoecology is the study of interactions between once-living organisms and their environmental surroundings. Interactions between organisms can take a variety of forms, including competition between similar organisms for resources, predation of one organism by another, and symbiosis between different organisms to enable each organism to survive and reproduce.

Using sediment core data to better understand the wooly mammoth extinction The Data Sediment core data related to the extinction of Mammuthus primigenius, St. Paul Island, Alaska, 2014. This dataset is brought to you by Matthew Wooller (he/him/his), an interdisciplinary scientist, applying stable isotope techniques to understand the influence of changing environmental conditions on past and present ecosystems. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What We Know Relict woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) populations survived on several small Beringian islands for thousands of years after mainland populations went extinct. Five independent indicators of extinction show that mammoths survived on St. Paul until 5,600 ± 100 years ago. Vegetation composition remained stable during the extinction window, and there is no evidence of human presence on the island before 1787 CE, suggesting tha=t these factors were not extinction drivers. What we found out Instead, the extinction coincided with declining freshwater resources and drier climates between 7,850 and 5,600 years ago, as inferred from sedimen-tary magnetic susceptibility, oxygen isotopes, and diatom and cla-doceran assemblages in a sediment core from a freshwater lake on the island, and stable nitrogen isotopes from mammoth remains. Contrary to other extinction models for the St. Paul mammoth population , this evidence indicates that this mammoth population died out because of the synergistic effects of shrinking island area and freshwater scarcity caused by rising sea levels and regional climate change. Degradation of water quality by intensified mammoth activity around the lake likely exacerbated the situation. The St. Paul mammoth demise is now one of the best-dated prehistoric extinctions, highlighting freshwater limitation as an overlooked extinction driver and underscoring the vulnerability of small island populations to environmental change, even in the absence of human influence.

There are two journal articles associated: Polar bears experience skeletal muscle atrophy in response to food deprivation and reduced activity in winter and summer Phenotypic plasticity and climate change: can polar bears respond to longer Arctic summers with an adaptive fast? What We Know When reducing activity and using stored energy during seasonal food shortages, animals risk degradation of skeletal muscles, although some species avoid or minimize the resulting atrophy while experiencing these conditions during hibernation. Polar bears may be food deprived and relatively inactive during winter (when pregnant females hibernate and hunting success declines for other demographic groups) as well as summer (when sea ice retreats from key foraging habitats). What we found out After capturing 57 adult female polar bears to assess their body condition and measure blood variables that indicate feeding, regular fasting, and adaptive fasting, we found that bears on shore maintained lipid and protein stores by scavenging on bowhead whale carcasses from human harvest, while those that followed the retreating sea ice beyond the continental shelf were food deprived.

His research group seeks to understand linkages between mobile top predators (birds) and aquatic food webs. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What We Know In the Arctic, rapid climate change has kindled efforts to delineate and project the future of important habitats for marine birds and mammals. These animals are vital to subsistence economies and cultures, so including the needs of both animals and hunters in conservation planning is key to sustaining social-ecological systems. In the northeast Chukchi Sea, a nearshore corridor of open water is a major spring migration route for half a million eider ducks that are hunted along the landfast ice. Zoning areas for industrial activities or conservation should consider both eider habitat and hunter access to those habitats from the variable ice edge. What we found out Based on benthic sampling in 2010‒2012, a model of eider foraging energetics and satellite data on ice patterns in April and May 1997‒2011, we mapped the range of positions of the landfast ice edge relative to a given dispersion of habitat suitable for eider feeding. In some sectors, feeding areas were too limited or too far from landfast ice to provide regular hunting access. In other sectors, overlap of the ice edge with eider feeding habitat was quite variable, but often within a consistent geographic range. Areas accessible to hunters were a small fraction of total eider habitat, so areas adequate for conserving eiders would not necessarily include areas that meet the hunters’ needs.
