Overview The Arctic Data Center is a place for researchers from around the world working in the Arctic to efficiently share, discover, access, and interpret complex data about the Arctic with less effort. Part of our mission is to provide hands-on training to researchers and students at Arctic and domain research conferences, as well as in dedicated training sessions targeting Arctic researchers. We especially target early-career and under-represented populations for our training opportunities. In 2020, we were able to support the development of undergraduate-level educational materials through our data fellowship program (NSF award number 1546024). These materials are open source and available for reuse and/or modification either at the associated Github repository, the Arctic Data Center Training page, or the DataONE Skillbuilding Hub. (Numbers last updated January 2021.) With over 6300 datasets, the Arctic Data Center repository is uniquely positioned to help more students understand one about one of the planet’s fastest-changing ecosystems: the Arctic. These educational materials are intended to equip students with the necessary tools and resources to unearth the story behind just a few of the datasets in the data catalog. Encompassing Earth’s northern most region, the Arctic is an icy sea that is surrounded by land, characterized by a harsh climate with extreme variation in light and temperature. Diverse landscapes — from the sea ice to coastal wetlands, upland tundra, mountains, wide rivers, and the sea itself — support abundant wildlife, geological features, and many cultures, making the Arctic a region like no other in the world. However, what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average (Serreze &amp; Barry, 2011). The cause of such rapid warming is straightforward and well understood: it is human-caused climate change, and it is altering the relative amount of the Sun’s energy that is absorbed, reflected, or radiated in the Arctic. According to the 15th annual NOAA Arctic Report Card, the sea ice extent in October of 2020 dropped to the lowest levels on record. Dramatic drops in Arctic ice like this are the main driver for rapid Arctic changes. Effects of a warming atmosphere on physical, chemical, biological, and human components of Arctic ecosystems are myriad, far-reaching, and accelerating Wendisch 2017. There is likely no facet of Arctic life that will remain untouched by the immensity of these changes. Studying and understanding the Arctic is essential to saving it, and ultimately ourselves. The Arctic Data Center repository is rich with real-world Arctic data just waiting to be explored. If you’re ready to learn how, let’s get started. Additionally, the National Wildlife Federation put together this Activity Guide if you’d like to learn more about the Arctic and climate change. "],["ocean.html", "Oceanography Frost flowers on young Arctic sea ice", " Oceanography This section features a dataset from the field of oceanography, the study of the physical and biological aspects of the ocean. The Arctic Ocean is the shallowest ocean on Earth. Its complex oceanographic configuration is tightly linked to the atmosphere, the land, and the cryosphere. The physical dynamics not only drive important climate and global circulation patterns, but also control biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem dynamics. Current changes in Arctic sea ice thickness and distribution, air and water temperatures, and water column stability are resulting in measurable shifts in the properties and functioning of the ocean and its ecosystems (Gradinger, 1995). The Arctic Ocean is forecasted to shift to a seasonally ice-free ocean resulting in changes to physical, chemical, and biological processes (Notz &amp; Stroeve, 2018). These changes include the exchange of gases across the atmosphere-ocean interface, the wind-driven circulation and mixing regimes, light and nutrient availability for primary production, food web dynamics, and export of material to the deep ocean. In anticipation of these changes, extending our knowledge of the present Arctic oceanography and these complex changes has never been more urgent. Frost flowers on young Arctic sea ice The Data Frost flowers in Arctic winter: Sea-to-air transport of microbes and viruses. This dataset is brought to you by Jody W. Deming (she/her), an American oceanographer. She is a professor of Oceanography and a marine microbiologist at the University of Washington. Her research interests include studies of cold adapted microbes in their relation to astrobiology, biotechnology, and bioremediation. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What we know New ice is becoming more common in the Arctic due to warming, so frost flowers - a phenomenon usually associated with new ice - are predicted to appear more often. Frost flowers are short lived clusters of ice crystals that form tree or snowflake-like structures on the warm, salty ice surface and the cold air in calm water conditions. These frost flowers are a way for the ocean to chemically react with the atmosphere, and are a potential source of a number of different aerosol comounds, like salts, organic particles, bromines, and/or halogens with a large mercury percentage. Frost flowers can also serve as a cryospheric habitat for microbs. The goal of this study was to investigate these frost flowers and understand what processes drive their growth and decay, as well as eamine their roles in geochemical and biological exchange. To investigate their microbiology, Bowman and Deming learned to grow frost flowers in a freezer lab at the University of Washington. Then then moved their study into the field, collecting frost flowers during several challenging expeditions at sea. With these first samples, they have begun to develop the concept of frost flowers as a microbial habitat. Their goal is to probe the secrets of microbial life in very cold environments, a priority shared with the astrobiology community. Since many of the planets and moons in our solar system that might harbor life are very cold and covered in ice, determining the habitability of these planets and moons requires an understanding of the limits of life (as we know it) in the very coldest environments on Earth. What we found out Ice grown in a pond that researchers cut in young, newly-formed ice at the mouth of Young Sound, NE Greenland, in March 2012, showed that expanding frost flower clusters began forming as soon as the ice formed. The new ice and frost flowers dramatically changed the thermal environment of the top layer of the ocean / atmosphere interface. The frost flowers were about 5°C colder than the brine surfac. More work needs to be done to understand the impact these frost flowers will have on the heat flux of the overall environment. In terms of how these frost flowers were formed, the researchers found out that they primarily take brine crystals from the salty top layer of the ice. When the frost flowers form, a type of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) called ikalite is also formed, which has the ability to alter the carbon flux dynamics. Bacteria concentrations generally increased with salinity in frost flowers and the surface slush layer, and the researchers found that largely the bacteria were brought into the structure of hte frost flower by passive diffusion. With more forst flowers expected in the future, more study is needed in all three areas of interest!

The Principal Investigator, Valeriy Mazepa (he/him), is a hydrologist interested in how climate and topography affect water, energy, and vegetation dynamics in natural landscapes. Currently, he is a Professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What we know According to NOAA’s Arctic Report Card, the Arctic has been warming at an accelerating rate over the last decade, which is exacerbated by land-atmosphere-ocean feedback loops. In addition to that warming, a significant expansion of larch forests to moss-lichen and heath tundra areas (called the “greening” of the Arctic) over the past 50-60 years has been documented in western Siberia, with horizontal displacement (that is, the slantiness of the tree - see below photo from Krause et al. 2013) rates of 32-58 meters per decade and altitudinal (height above sea level) rates of 3-4 meters per decade. These vegetation changes may have the potential to impact regional hydrology and climate, as well as those feedbacks. We need to better understand these cycles in order to better model and predict Arctic warming, and as it stands (at least as of this paper’s publication in 2019), we don’t have enough field measurements from meteorological stations to quantify what’s happening. Rather than focus on getting those field measurements, it’s more efficient to use a model. This study wanted to confirm that the maximum entropy production (MEP) model would be accurate for predicting energy budgets in the Arctic across a range of vegetation gradients in Arctic permafrost landscapes. What we found out Growing season latent and sensible heat flux are nearly equal over the Arctic permafrost tundra regions. ″Sensible heat″ is ″sensed″ or felt in a process as a change in the land’s temperature. ″Latent heat″ is energy transferred in a process without change of the land’s temperature, for example, in a phase change (solid/liquid/gas). Persistent ground heat flux into the subsurface layer leads to seasonal thaw of the top permafrost layer. The Maximum Energy Production model described in this paper accurately estimates the latent, sensible, and ground heat flux of the surface energy budget of the Arctic permafrost regions. What’s In The Data This dataset contains two .csv files for the tundra energy budget and for the tree energy budget. They both contain the same variables: datetime (summer), Net Radiation (W/sq m), Shortwave Down (W/sq m), Shortwave Up (W/sq m), Air Temperature (Celsius), Surface Skin Temperature (Celsius), Relative Humidity (decimal), Surface Specific Humidity (kg/kg), Wind Speed (m/s), SapflowSignal Atmospheric tracers for Arctic wildfires, air pollution, atmospheric chemistry, and climate change at GEOSummit, Greenland The GEOSummit (Source) The Data Atmospheric tracers for Arctic wildfires, air pollution, atmospheric chemistry, and climate change at GEOSummit, Greenland, since 2018.

The Principal Investigator, Christine Wiedinmyer (she/her), is the Associate Director for Science at Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. Her research has focused on the emissions of trace gases and particles to the atmosphere and how these emissions impact atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate. She also investigates the effects of global change on these processes, such as how land cover and land use change alter the fluxes of trace gases to the atmosphere. What we know There has been a major increase in Arctic wildfires in recent years (Masrur et al. 2017), and it’s been suggested that these fires are increasing because the summers have been drier as a result of higher temperatures. This NSF-funded Arctic Observing Network (AON) project focused on the study of Arctic tundra wildfires through continuous observations of atmospheric fire tracers (airborne gases that tell us information about the age of the fire and what material is being burned), including carbon monoxide, methane, and a series of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitored at the Greenland Environmental Observatory at Summit Station (GEOSummit), the only high altitude, high latitude, inland, year‐round observing station in the Arctic. These data will be used to understand the impacts that these wildfires are having, and will improve modeling efforts. What the data is about This continually updating dataset is an archive of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, acetylene, iso-pentane, n-pentane, n-hexane, benzene, toluene) in ambient air mixing ratios collected at GEOSummit since 2018, and updated regularly. These observations have been and will continue to be applied in modeling research to simulate Arctic wildfires, and to assess climate change-induced increases in Arctic wildfires and their feedback on the Arctic environment.

The Principal Investigator, Donatella Zona (she/her), a biologist with dual appointments at San Diego State University as an assistant professor of Biology and at the University of Sheffield (UK) as a senior research fellow. Her research interests include the impact of climate change on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and greenhouse gas emission in the Arctic. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What We Know Tundra ecosystmes historically have been a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) but now, some sites are becoming net sources; and understanding these dynamics is increasingly important to the annual carbon balance of these vulnerable polar ecosystems (Shaver et al, 1992). Currently, the Arctic is responsible for about 3% of methane emissions, and most likely that percentage will increase with climate change. When the permafrost warms, gas releases from the frozen soils, which offsets almost half of the summer uptake of CO2 that happens from the photosynthesizing plants. It’s important to understand what the microbial community is doing in response to changing conditions so that we can understand what drives large carbon dioxide and methane emissions - for example, some bacteria are methanogens (which means they release methane) and others release carbon dioxide, so knowing how the community changes tells us how the greenhouse gases may change. The goal of this study was to understand the permafrost redox state (ie, the balance of decomoposition chemical reactions) using pore water samples, soil cores, and edd covariance tower carbon fluxes. What we found out The researchers analyzed freeze–thaw processes through in situ CO2 and CH4 fluxes in conjunction with soil cores for physical structure and porewater samples for redox biogeochemistry (for more information about redox biogeochemical processes, see Borch et al. 2009). In those soil cores, Dr. Zona’s team found that water moves toward freezing fronts in soil cores, which leaves air pockets in soils. Those air pockets means that oxygen‐rich snow melt in spring can trickle down into the pockets and provide the bacterial community with the oxygen they need to perform cellular respiration. Without that meltwater and the oxygen contained within it, bacteria are only able to break down compounds via anaeobic pathways (without oxygen) or methane-generating pathways. With warming projected to increase in the future, the snow melt period will likely increase as well, giving more time for these net carbon source conditions to persist.

Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with one another and with their physical environment. The distribution and abundance of organisms on Earth is shaped by both biotic - living organism-related - and abiotic - nonliving or physical - factors.

Oberbauer, Jonathan Moser, Gregory Starr, and Behzad Mortazavi. Steven Oberbauer (he/him) is a Professor and the Chairperson of the Biological Sciences Department at Florida International University. His research interests include plant and ecosystem physiology, energy balance, plant phenology and productivity of vascular plants and bryophytes, particularly in response to climate change. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What We Know We learn in school that photosynthesis is the process by which plants make glucose (energy) from the sun. The assumption there is that plants can only do that when it’s sunny out, but that’s not true - in fact, evergreen plants can phtosynthesize at any time of the year, including winter, if conditions are favorable. Evergreen plants (like pines) in the Arctic can even do so when their leaves are covered in snow, which may help them offset cellular respiration carbon loss that happens in the winter. That said, the plants still need water to photosynthesize, and it’s unclear at this time how the plants obtain the water from the frozen soil. This study wanted to find out how that happens, so they enriched meltwater with a hydrogen isotope to see if plants were rehydrating during the winter via their roots or via their leaves. What we found out Based on the results of these experiments, it seems like evergreen tundra plants do take up water under snow cover both via roots and leaves. The results from the community of plants as well as on the individual plant level confirm that there was more of the enriched hydrogen in the plant than the baseline enriched hydrogen in the ground on all of the sampling days (Figure 1). Figure 1 from Moser et al. 2016: Enriched hydrogen (y axis) increased in leaves and stems relative to the baseline (triangle symbol). (Source: Moser, J. G., Oberbauer, S. F., Sternberg, L. D.

Disturbing the soil increased uptake of the tracer water, since that would fracture the top ice layer and let more water into the soil pores. These evergreen plants have likely adapted to uptake water in the winter to offset their carbon losses due to respiration - tundra plants are small, and don’t have the large storage capacity of more southern trees.

What We Know Aufeis (German for “on ice”) is a collection of massive accumulations of ice that are common to many Arctic rivers. It forms at river “choke points” where the water is forced upwards on top of the ice, and then freezes in layers. Successive cycles of overflow result in accumulations of enormous volumes of ice, with aufeis on some Alaskan rivers attaining thicknesses of 3-5 meters (9-15 feet), covering more than 20 square kilometers (7.72 square miles), and storing as much as 30% of the annual river discharge. When they thaw, they leave aufeis “barrens”, areas where vascular plants won’t grow due to the ice cover. They serve as water sources in the summer, local habitat for fish and mammals, and also as perenially unforzen real estate for communities of groundwater invertebrates. As many as 80 different species create complex food and nutient webs in these aufeis sediments. Although aufeis has been studied by hydrologists and is known to be required for winter and spawning habitat for some fish, understanding of their ecology is poor. The goal of this study was to document the groundwater invertebrate communities and establish aufeis as an important habitat area for these organisms. What we found out The Kuparuk aufeis field that these authors investigate provides subsurface habitat for approximately 50 different species of freshwater invertebrates, which are largely different from those that live on the surface level habitats. The diversity found here is likely made possible by the high porosity (ie, lots of empty space) of the subsurface sediments, combined with a high level of connectivity between those pore spaces. Additionally, the subsurface habitat likely saw higher levels of species richness due to variety in the environment - the authors demonstrated that there were areas of upwelling and downwelling in the pore spaces. Figure 6 from Huryn et al 2020 showing some of the groundwater invertebrates in the subsurface habitat. This large habitat was unexpected, so these conclusions are (pardon the pun!) groundbreaking! Previously, it was thought that the permafrost underlying the stream sediments would be frozen solid, leaving this rich community of invertebrates no habitat to colonize. Rarefaction curves for invertebrates sampled from aufeis wells (closed circles) and surface sediments (open circles). The mean cumulative number of taxa per number of samples is plotted as a function of accumulated number of individuals sampled. Note: In ecology, rarefaction is a technique to assess species richness from the results of sampling. Rarefaction allows the calculation of species richness for a given number of individual samples based on the construction of so-called rarefaction curves. This curve is a plot of the number of species as a function of the number of samples. Rarefaction curves generally grow rapidly at first, as the most common species are found, but the curves plateau as only the rarest species remain to be sampled.

This dataset is brought to you by Ben Abbott (he/him), an Assistant Professor of Ecosystem Ecology at Brigham Young University. Ben works primarily on the permafrost climate feedback and water quality in river networks. Drawing on biogeochemistry, evolutionary biology, and social science, his research investigates how the co-evolution of landscapes and ecosystems results in broad-scale patterns of biological, hydrological, and socioeconomic behavior. Specifically, he studies how permafrost collapse, agriculture, fire, and flooding affect carbon and nutrient cycles in soil, groundwater, rivers, and lakes. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What We Know In cold environments, decomposition of organic material is often limited due to temperatures. There isn’t as much organic matter being broken down by microbes, so that leads to a build up of organic matter in the soil. Normally, that doesn’t cause any problems for the ecosystem, and the carbon and nitrogen cycles are “used” to the status quo. However, the build up of soil organic matter (SOM) can be an issue when global warming enters the mix. As the climate warms, the soil is no longer too cold for decomposition - which means the carbon stored in that permafrost may release. Permafrost contains more than half of the world’s soil organic matter, so this is no small scale concern. Increases in thermokarst (permafrost collapse due to ground ice melt) exposes that SOM, and based on some warming projections, thermokarst could affect 20-50% of upland areas by the end of the century. There are three morpologies (or, shapes) of thermokarst that are common: retrogressive thaw slumps, active layer detachment slides, and thermo-erosion gullies. The researchers here investigated whether or not the type of thermokarst affected the carbon and nitrogen release of the newly exposed soils. Photo references: Costard et al 2020, Blais-Stevens et al 2015, and Sidorchuk 2019. What we found out After measuring soil organic matter displacement, ecosystem respiration (ie, all photosynthesis and cellular respiration processes happening by all organisms), and soil gas concentrations (methane CH4, carbon dioxide CO2, and nitrous oxide N2O) at 26 upland thermokarst spots on the North Slope of Alaska, the researchers found that the shape of the thermokarst feature does impact the nutrient cycles and soil organic matter degradation. Because slumps and slides move a large amount of carbon material somewhere else, the ecosystem respiration was LESS after the thermokarst feature was formed. Gullies, on the other hand, largely kept the carbon local but increased ecosystem respiration and concentration of nitrous oxide. The increase in nitrous oxide was interesting - the concentration stayed high through most of the summer, which suggests that there was more nitrification and denitrification happening in these soils. Usually permafrost thaw is associated with carbon, so the impact on the nitrogen cycle represents a new possible climate impact, given that gulliesm ake up over half of all thermokarst and N2O has a global warming potential that is 300x that of CO2. This work is key to including thermokarst in climate models so that we’re accurately predicting carbon and nitrogen release from thawing permafrost.

Using sediment core data to better understand the woolly mammoth extinction The Data Sediment core data related to the extinction of Mammuthus primigenius, St. Paul Island, Alaska, 2014. This dataset is brought to you by Matthew Wooller (he/him), an interdisciplinary scientist who works on applying stable isotope techniques to understand the influence of changing environmental conditions on past and present ecosystems. Isotopes (of C,N,O,H and Sr) feature as the primary analytical tools that Dr. Wooller uses to study a wide range of environmental and ecological questions. The full paper associated with this dataset is available here. What We Know Even though most mainland woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) populations went extinct on mainland North America around 14,000 years ago, some populations survived on several small Beringian islands for thousands of years later. Specifically, woolly mammoth populations on St. Paul Island were likely alive until about 6,000 years ago. Normally, extinction happens because of environmental change, human impacts, or a combination of both. But, St. Paul Island wasn’t populated by humans until the 1700s, so these researchers were able to study when and why these mammals went extinct specifically from environmental change. The prevailing hypotheses as to why these animals died out were that there was a change in vegetation or an increase in snowpack; these authors used sediment core proxy methods and radio carbon dating of 14 newly discovered mammoth remains to better understand what happened. What we found out The authors were able to pretty precisely pinpoint when the extinction happened: 5,600 +- 100 years ago. All five of the independent indicators that the team measured (sedimentary ancient DNA, 3 different fungi, and the radio carbon dating) agreed, and this study is the most robust and precise estimate of an extinction ever recorded. Photo credit: Graham et al. 2016 Figure 2. Caption from the paper: Timing of woolly mammoth extinction on St. Paul. Five indicators are plotted against time (calendar years before 1950 CE): sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA; green and red circles indicate inferred presence and absence, respectively), direct AMS radiocarbon dates on mammoth remains (black crosses), and spore accumulation rates for the coprophilous fungi Sporormiella (medium green, bottom of stack), Sordaria (light green, middle), and Podospora (dark green, top) (spores yr-1 cm-2). Magnetic susceptibility, in arbitrary units (AU) of Lake Hill sediments, sea level (m), and St. Paul Island area (km2) are shown for comparison. Note the truncation by plot of highest peak of magnetic susceptibility at 1,500 AU. The yellow band indicates inferred timing of extinction at 5,600 ± 100 y ago. Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of sediment characteristics; its rapid decline indicates a rapid reduction in watershed erosion at the same time as the extinction. The major drivers behind this extinction were all related to freshwater availability on the island: lake shallowing, increased water turbidity, and increased salinity. Without fresh water, of course, mammoths would be unable to survive. Understanding why the freshwater decreased is a more difficult endeavor, and the authors hypothesized that it was related to sea level rise, climate change, and overuse of the freshwater resource by the mammoths. The St. Paul mammoth demise is now one of the best-dated prehistoric extinctions, highlighting freshwater limitation as an overlooked extinction driver and underscoring the vulnerability of small island populations to environmental change, even in the absence of human influence.

Polar Bears: Muscle analyses. Polar Bears: Breath analyses. These datasets are brought to you by Henry J. Harlow, Merav Ben-David, John P. Whiteman, and George M. Durner.

Merav Ben-David is an Israeli-American ecologist, zoologist, and politician who is the Chair of the Department of Zoology and Physiology at the University of Wyoming. There are two journal articles associated with these 8 datasets: Polar bears experience skeletal muscle atrophy in response to food deprivation and reduced activity in winter and summer Phenotypic plasticity and climate change: can polar bears respond to longer Arctic summers with an adaptive fast? What We Know When animals aren’t moving much or don’t have enough to eat, they breakdown their muscles to access that stored energy, which casuses their mucles to atrophy (or degrade). Animals that hibernate or are otherwise adapted to going without food or activity for long periods of time often have adaptive strategies to avoid that muscle loss since they have to remain alert and able to move quickly if disturbed. For example, black bears only lose 23% of their muscle mass over hibernation, while similar hibernation stragies in a human would reduce our muscle mass by 90%. However, those same adaptations used during hibernation in the winter aren’t activated when an animal doesn’t have enough food in the summer. That’s a concern because with climate change altering the sea ice, polar bears are having to scavenge whale carcasses left by Indigenous hunters, and are experiencing food deprivation as a result. The researchers from this study looked at polar bears in the winter during hibernation and during the summer when they have less food available to see how their bodies changed in response to less food and less activity. What We Found Out All of the polar bears sampled experienced muscle atrophy during the winter regardless of whether they hibernated or not, but they largely recovered their muscle lost during the winter during the spring and summer, when they were able to hunt successfully. That said, the difference between teh minimum and maximum extent of protein was 17% - which is high compared to other species of bears. They also noticed in their study that food deprivation may influence atrophy in muscles more than hibernation activity. With sea ice loss increasing, the risk of muscle atrophy is also increasing for polar bears. With that change in muscle, that may affect their hunting ability, especially since they travel long distances and are ambush predators that rely on surprising and then overpowering their prey.

"],["mangement.html", "Environmental Management Sustaining ecological and subsistence functions in conservation areas: eider habitat and access by Native hunters along landfast ice, Alaska", " Environmental Management The dataset featured in this section focuses on environmental management. Environmental management is concerned with the understanding of the structure and function of the earth system, as well as of the ways in which humans relate to their environment. Environmental management is therefore concerned with the description and monitoring of environmental changes, with predicting future changes and with attempts to maximize human benefit and to minimize environmental degradation due to human activities.

Sustaining ecological and subsistence functions in conservation areas: eider habitat and access by Native hunters along landfast ice, Alaska King Eider (Source) The Data Sustaining ecological and subsistence functions in conservation areas: eider habitat and access by Native hunters along landfast ice, Alaska, 1997-2011. This dataset is brought to you by Aariel Rocha, James Lovvorn, Andrew Mahoney, and Stephen Jewett. The Principal Investigator James Lovvorn (he/him) is a Professor at Southern Illinois University. His research group seeks to understand linkages between mobile top predators (birds) and aquatic food webs. The full paper associated with this dataset is avalible here. What We Know When populations and habitats are vulnerable to climate change, efforts are often made to set up “safe spaces” for breeding populations so that they have space and the environment to recover. The Arctic, though, is more complicated than other environments - in addition to Arctic amplification, which means that climate change is accelerating faster in these regions, the Arctic is also home to Indigenous peoples who hunt as part of their way of life. Hunting for the Inupiat of Arctic Alaska and the Inuit farther northeast in Canada is about more than just getting enough food to survive - it’s also about promoting social traditions, caring for the weaker community members, and transferring culture across generations. Populations of animals like walruses, seals, and eiders (a kind of bird) are all part of subsistence hunting traditions but are also responding to climate changes - how do we protect these animals but also protect Indigenous access as well? Climate change is having a substantial affect on Arctic ice, which is making hunting these traditional animals less predictable - and more dangerous - for Indigenous communities. Management decisions that affect these species have to also include maintaining healthy and resilient Native communities. This particular research is using the eiders as an example for how to do that. The researchers investigate where the eiders are feeding (places on the ice where there are major densities of eider prey) and where the landfast ice edge (where the ice is still safe for Indigenous hunters to stand on to hunt eiders) is - the intersection of those two areas should be where conservation efforts are concentrated. What We Found Out Over the 15 years of data collection, the edge of the landfast ice was more or less in the same spot. The coastline of Skull Bay provides both good habitat for the eiders and hunting access to them - but the overlap of those two regions (of good feeding grounds and good hunting grounds) is small: an average of 4.2% of the total habitat area in Skull Bay, 1.3% in the Waiwirght segment, and 0.7% in the Ledyard Bay segment, and 0% (no overlap) in the Point Hope segment. These areas of overlap would be good to designate as “high priority subsistence conservation areas” to protect both the populations and Indigenous access to them. However, these locations are not fixed in time, and so keeping up with what areas are these high priority subsistence conservation areas would require upkeep. Summertime warming, which leads to a shrinking polar ice cap, is changing the landfast ice slowly and causing ice free conditions to move earlier in the year. Changing winds also have an effect on the locations of these feeding areas and whether hunters can access them. Figure 3 from Lovvorn et al 2018 - showing how often feeding grounds for eiders and places where Indigenous communities can hunt those eiders overlap. Over 1997-2011, the maximum number of years those areas overlapped was 9 years. Environmental management decisions are sometimes viewed negatively by Native communities, since historically, there hasn’t been local control over what areas are managed and how. Considering both the needs of the human communities as well as the animal communities is essential for conservation planning moving forward.
