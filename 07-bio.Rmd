There are two journal articles associated with these 8 datasets: 

1. [Polar bears experience skeletal muscle atrophy in response to food deprivation and reduced activity in winter and summer](https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/5/1/cox049/4079877)
2. [Phenotypic plasticity and climate change: can polar bears respond to longer Arctic summers with an adaptive fast?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29197040/)

**What We Know**

When animals aren't moving much or don't have enough to eat, they breakdown their muscles to access that stored energy, which casuses their mucles to atrophy (or degrade). Animals that hibernate or are otherwise adapted to going without food or activity for long periods of time often have adaptive strategies to avoid that muscle loss since they have to remain alert and able to move quickly if disturbed. For example, black bears only lose 23% of their muscle mass over hibernation, while similar hibernation stragies in a human would reduce our muscle mass by 90%. However, those same adaptations used during hibernation in the winter aren't activated when an animal doesn't have enough food in the summer.

That's a concern because with climate change altering the sea ice, polar bears are having to scavenge whale carcasses left by Indigenous hunters, and are experiencing food deprivation as a result. The researchers from this study looked at polar bears in the winter during hibernation and during the summer when they have less food available to see how their bodies changed in response to less food and less activity.

**What We Found Out**

All of the polar bears sampled experienced muscle atrophy during the winter regardless of whether they hibernated or not, but they largely recovered their muscle lost during the winter during the spring and summer, when they were able to hunt successfully. That said, the difference between teh minimum and maximum extent of protein was 17% - which is high compared to other species of bears. They also noticed in their study that food deprivation may influence atrophy in muscles more than hibernation activity. With sea ice loss increasing, the risk of muscle atrophy is also increasing for polar bears. With that change in muscle, that may affect their hunting ability, especially since they travel long distances and are ambush predators that rely on surprising and then overpowering their prey.
