# *Bonus: Arctic Happenings* {-#greenland}

[Arctic Happenings](https://ahrl.rutgers.edu/greenland-lessons) is a four-part educational module series designed for upper middle school, high school, and undergraduate students.

These materials were created by [Dr. Missy Holzer](https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/seminars-on-science/about/faculty/margaret-holzer) and [Dr. Ã…sa Rennermalm](https://ahrl.rutgers.edu/). Dr. Holzer (she/her) is a veteran high school teacher of Earth & Space Science, Physical Geography, and AP Environmental Science in Chatham, NJ. Dr. Rennermalm (she/her) is an associate professor of Geography at Rutgers University.

All digital materials and the [publication](https://www.nestanet.org/cms/sites/default/files/journal/Holzer_Winter19.pdf) for this module are freely available online and include rich video and data resources plus step-by-step instructions. 

This teaching module consists of four activities which all comply with the Next Generation Science Standards for grades 6-8 and 9-12:

*Activity 1: My Burning Feet (Engage)*
This activity has students using infrared thermometers to introduce them to the concept of surface albedo (the proportion of light reflected by a surface from  0-1).

*Activity 2: From burning feet to the Greenland Ice Sheet: Examining model estimates of Greenland ice sheet mass loss, its drivers, and its impact on global sea levels (Explore and Explain)*
This activity has students modeling and analyzing Greenland ice sheet spatial datasets with ImageJ software. Real data from the [Modele Atmospherique Regional (MAR)](https://mar.cnrs.fr/) helps student simulate atmosphere-land mass and energy fluxes over Greenland.

*Activity 3: Should I Move Inland? What About Others Around the World - Should They Move to Higher Ground? (Elaborate)*
This activity has students investigating sea level rise in the coastal US, creating a report from the presepctive of a governmental researcher, and presenting their findings.

*Activity 4: How Does Melting Arctic Ice (sea ice &amp;amp;amp; ice sheets) Impact the Climate Where I live? (Evaluate)*
This activity has students synthesizing what they've learned in the previous three modules and extending that to Arctic sea ice, bringing in real data to back up their hypotheses.
