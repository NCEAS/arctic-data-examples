# **Permafrost** {-#perm}

In this section, datasets focus on the study of the Arctic permafrost. Permafrost is any type of ground — from soil to sediment to rock — that has been frozen continuously for a minimum of two years and as many as hundreds of thousands of years.

**What we know**

Cold seasons in Arctic ecosystems are increasingly important to the annual carbon balance of these vulnerable polar ecosystems [(Shaver et al, 1992)](https://doi.org/10.2307/1311862). Arctic winters are largely harsh and often cause field work to be inaccessible by research, which led in the past to data gaps during that season. Until recently, cold seasons were assumed to have negligible impacts on the annual carbon balance, but as data coverage increases during winters and the Arctic warms, the cold season has been shown to account for over half of annual methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions and can offset summer photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) uptake. Freeze–thaw cycle dynamics play a critical role in controlling cold season CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> loss, but the relationship has not been extensively studied. 

**What we found out**

The researchers analyzed freeze–thaw processes through in situ CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes in conjunction with soil cores for physical structure and porewater samples for redox biogeochemistry [(for more information about redox biogeochemical processes, see Borch et al. 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1021/es9026248). In those soil cores, Dr. Zona's team found a movement of water toward freezing fronts in soil cores, leaving air spaces in soils, which allows for rapid infiltration of oxygen‐rich snow melt in spring as shown by the oxidized iron present in the porewater. The snow melt period coincides with rising ecosystem respiration, and can offset up to 41% of the summer CO<sub>2</sub> uptake.
